# A basic Tic Tac Toe game written in C

A basic game that I wrote in C by following along with Bro Code on Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87SH2Cn0s9A)

The console output looks like this when you run it:

########################################################################

Enter a row to place your move #(1-3): 3

Enter a column to place your move #(1-3): 3

You moved at row 3, column 3.
 X |   |

---+---+---

   | X | O

---+---+---

   | O | X

You win!

Play again? (y/n):n

Thanks for playing!

You'll need the GCC compiler installed to compile and rerun the code with any updates that you make.
